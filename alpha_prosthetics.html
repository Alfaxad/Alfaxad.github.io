    <h2>What we're building</h2>
    <p>We are creating <span class="highlight">Alpha Prosthetics</span>, a venture dedicated to developing affordable, accessible, and durable prosthetic devices tailored to the needs of people with disabilities in Tanzania and other African countries. By utilizing innovative technologies such as 3D printing and modular design, we aim to significantly reduce the cost of prosthetic limbs while maintaining high quality and functionality. Our prosthetics are designed to withstand the diverse environmental conditions in Africa.</p>

    <p>By establishing local production facilities and training programs, we intend to make these essential devices readily available, even in remote areas. Our holistic approach includes collaborating with local healthcare providers, NGOs, and government agencies to create a sustainable ecosystem that supports amputees from fitting to rehabilitation.</p>

    <h2>Why we're doing this</h2>
    <p>In Tanzania and across Africa, there is a significant shortage of prosthetic devices for people with disabilities. Financial constraints make prosthetics unaffordable for many amputees and their families. Limited healthcare infrastructure, including a scarcity of trained prosthetists and inadequate facilities, hinders access to prosthetic services. Many amputees, especially in rural areas, have little to no access to the necessary care and devices, leading to severe limitations in mobility and independence.</p>
    
    <!-- Second image after first paragraph of Why we're doing this -->
    <img src="images/pros2.png" alt="Prosthetic limbs on display">

    <p>According to the World Health Organization, only <span class="highlight">5-15% of people</span> who require assistive devices in low- and middle-income countries have access to them. In Tanzania, many amputees live on the streets due to the lack of available prosthetics, highlighting the urgent need for affordable solutions. Our mission with <span class="highlight">Alpha Prosthetics</span> is to empower these individuals by providing prosthetics that improve mobility, enhance quality of life, and foster social and economic inclusion.</p>

    <h2>How we know how to do this</h2>
    <p>With over five years of experience in AI, machine learning, and embedded software development, in various fields such as healthacare and agriculture I bring a wealth of technical expertise to this project. As a mechanical and electrical systems engineering student at Kyoto University of Advanced Science (KUAS), I have honed my skills in integrating complex systems, programming,  design and implement advanced prosthetic devices effectively.</p>

    

    <h2>Why we are in the best position to work on this</h2>
    <p>As a Tanzanian dedicated to advancing Africa's technological landscape, I am uniquely positioned to lead <span class="highlight">Alpha Prosthetics</span>. I have witnessed firsthand the struggles of individuals who lack access to prosthetics, motivating me to create a solution that can make a tangible difference in their lives.</p>

    <p>By My technical knowledge and deep understanding of the problem and the solution required not only enables me to better execute the solution but also a wide room for impact and scalability of prosthetics services in Africa.</p>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>We are currently in the research and development phase, having completed a comprehensive analysis of the challenges faced by amputees in Tanzania and potential solutions. Initial #D designs for affordable, modular prosthetic devices suitable for local conditions have been developed. And with the Promise Prize Fellowship, much can be achieved to bring this technology in Tanzania and eventually all of Africa. </p>
