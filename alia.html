    <h2>What we're building</h2>
    <p>We are developing <span class="highlight">ALIA</span>, an innovative, solar-powered drip irrigation system that is easy to operate, maintain, and can be controlled remotely via SMS. ALIA combines renewable energy with efficient water management to provide smallholder farmers with an affordable and accessible solution to enhance agricultural productivity.</p>
    <p>The system includes a solar-powered water pump, a network of low-flow drip irrigation pipes delivering water directly to plant roots, and an SMS-based control unit that allows farmers to manage irrigation schedules using any basic mobile phone. By integrating optional soil moisture sensors, ALIA can further optimize water usage by automating irrigation based on real-time soil conditions.</p>

    <h2>Why we're doing this</h2>
    <p>Tanzania has significant agricultural potential, with vast expanses of arable land. However, only a small fraction of this land is currently irrigated, leaving farmers heavily reliant on rain-fed agriculture. This dependence exposes them to the vulnerabilities of droughts and the adverse effects of climate change, leading to inconsistent yields and food insecurity. Traditional irrigation methods, such as surface and flood irrigation, are inefficient and result in substantial water loss through evaporation and runoff.</p>

    <p>Smallholder farmers face numerous challenges in adopting modern irrigation technologies. High initial costs, limited access to finance, and insufficient technical knowledge create barriers that prevent them from improving their farming practices. Our mission with <span class="highlight">ALIA</span> is to empower these farmers by providing a sustainable, cost-effective irrigation solution that conserves water, increases crop yields, and enhances livelih
