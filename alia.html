    <h2>What we're building</h2>
    <p>We are developing <span class="highlight">ALIA</span>, an innovative, solar-powered drip irrigation system that is easy to operate, maintain, and can be controlled remotely via SMS. ALIA combines renewable energy with efficient water management to provide smallholder farmers with an affordable and accessible solution to enhance agricultural productivity.</p>
    <p>The system includes a solar-powered water pump, a network of low-flow drip irrigation pipes delivering water directly to plant roots, and an SMS-based control unit that allows farmers to manage irrigation schedules using any basic mobile phone. By integrating optional soil moisture sensors, ALIA can further optimize water usage by automating irrigation based on real-time soil conditions.</p>

    <h2>Why we're doing this</h2>
    <p>Tanzania has significant agricultural potential, with vast expanses of arable land. However, only a small fraction of this land is currently irrigated, leaving farmers heavily reliant on rain-fed agriculture. This dependence exposes them to the vulnerabilities of droughts and the adverse effects of climate change, leading to inconsistent yields and food insecurity. Traditional irrigation methods, such as surface and flood irrigation, are inefficient and result in substantial water loss through evaporation and runoff.</p>
    <!-- Second image after first paragraph of Why we're doing this -->
    <img src="images/farmers.png" alt="Farmers working with irrigation technology">
    <p>Smallholder farmers face numerous challenges in adopting modern irrigation technologies. High initial costs, limited access to finance, and insufficient technical knowledge create barriers that prevent them from improving their farming practices. Our mission with <span class="highlight">ALIA</span> is to empower these farmers by providing a sustainable, cost-effective irrigation solution that conserves water, increases crop yields, and enhances livelihoods. By harnessing solar energy and enabling remote control via SMS, we aim to make advanced irrigation technology accessible to even the most resource-constrained farmers, contributing to food security and economic growth in rural communities.</p>

    <h2>How we know how to do this</h2>
    <p>With over five years of experience in AI, machine learning, and embedded software development, I bring a wealth of technical expertise to this project.</p>
    <p> As a mechanical and electrical systems engineering student at Kyoto University of Advanced Science (KUAS). I have worked on equally important problems of the same magnitude sucha as automated energy management systems for microgrids, this experience has made it possible for me to conceptualize and design the proposed irrigation systems.</p>

    <h2>Why we are in the best position to work on this</h2>
    <!-- Third image after the title "Why we are in the best position to work on this" -->

    <p>As a Tanzanian dedicated to advancing Africa's technological landscape, I am uniquely positioned to lead the development of <span class="highlight">ALIA</span>. My deep understanding of the Tanzanians aggricultural sector and the specific challenges faced by smallholder farmers enables me to tailor the <span class="highlight">ALIA</span> system to their needs effectively.  I have witnessed firsthand the struggles of farmers who lack access to reliable irrigation, motivating me to create a solution that can make a tangible difference in their lives.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, studying in Japan has given me exposure to cutting-edge technologies and methodologies that I can adapt and apply to the Tanzanian context. My background in mechanical and electrical systems engineering provides the technical foundation necessary for designing and implementing a complex system like <span class="highlight">ALIA</span>. With the support of the Promise Prize Fellowship, we can significantly increase food production and advance farming technology in Tanzania and beyond.</p>
