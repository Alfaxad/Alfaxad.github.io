    <h2>What we're building</h2>
    <p>We are creating <span class="highlight">ALFA: Advanced Livestock Farming Assistant</span>, a groundbreaking system that integrates <span class="highlight">solar-powered environmental controls</span> and <span class="highlight">AI-powered health monitoring</span> to revolutionize poultry farming in Tanzania. By using cutting-edge technology, our system helps regulate key environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, ensuring optimal living conditions for poultry, especially in regions with unpredictable climates.</p>

    <p>The AI-powered health monitoring system detects early signs of disease and health issues in poultry, allowing farmers to respond quickly and efficiently. <span class="highlight">ALFA</span> automates the tracking and monitoring of bird health, helping farmers manage their flocks more effectively. The system is powered by affordable solar panels, making it accessible even to small-scale farmers in rural areas who might have limited access to electricity.</p>

    <h2>Why we're doing this</h2>
    <p>Tanzaniaâ€™s poultry sector plays a critical role in food security and economic development, with millions of households relying on poultry for income and sustenance. However, environmental challenges, such as high temperatures and humidity, as well as disease outbreaks, pose significant risks to the health and productivity of poultry. Many smallholder farmers, especially those in rural areas, lack the resources and infrastructure to manage these risks effectively.</p>

    <!-- Second image after first paragraph of Why we're doing this -->
    <img src="images/chick2.png" alt="Chicks in poultry farm close-up">
    
    <p>Current farming methods often lead to high mortality rates and reduced egg or meat production due to poor environmental conditions and delayed detection of diseases. As temperatures continue to rise and the risk of disease increases, there is a pressing need for innovative solutions that can help farmers manage these challenges sustainably. <span class="highlight">ALFA</span> addresses these issues by providing a reliable, low-cost, and sustainable solution for small and large-scale poultry farmers alike.</p>

    <h2>How we know how to do this</h2>
    <p>With over five years of experience in AI, machine learning, and systems engineering, I have the knowledge and experience required to develop and implement <span class="highlight">ALFA</span>. As a mechanical and electrical systems engineering student at Kyoto University of Advanced Science (KUAS), I have honed my skills in designing sustainable, automated systems that can be applied to real-world challenges, including agriculture.</p>

    <p>My previous work on AI-powered solutions, such as <span class="highlight">quantum machine learning for cardiomegaly detection</span> and <span class="highlight">energy management optimization</span>, demonstrates my ability to apply cutting-edge technology to solve complex problems. </p>

    <h2>Why we are in the best position to work on this</h2>
    <p> I have first-hand experience with the issues faced by poultry farmers in rural areas. My mom paid for my education through poultry farming, and now looking back, I realize that this could have been done way more efficiently. I have a deep understanding of the problem to come up with solutions for situations where
         access to reliable environmental controls and veterinary services is often limited. By developing a solution that is affordable, sustainable, and easy to use, <span class="highlight">ALFA</span> can make a significant impact on the lives of smallholder farmers.</p>

    <p>My connections with local farmers, agricultural organizations, and technology experts in both Tanzania and Japan provide me with the resources and support needed to successfully develop and deploy <span class="highlight">ALFA</span>. Studying in Japan has also given me access to the latest advancements in renewable energy and AI technology, which I am applying to this project.</p>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>We are currently in the <span class="highlight">prototype development</span> stage of <span class="highlight">ALFA</span>, focusing on designing the  solar-powered environmental controls with AI-powered health monitoring systems.</p>

    <p>By applying for the <span class="highlight">Promise Prize Fellowship</span> nomination, we seek financial support and mentorship to further develop, test, and scale <span class="highlight">ALFA</span> across Tanzania. Our vision is to deploy <span class="highlight">ALFA</span> in both rural and urban farming environments, helping to create a more sustainable, efficient, and productive poultry farming sector. With the right support, <span class="highlight">ALFA</span> has the potential to not only transform poultry farming in Tanzania but also serve as a model for innovation in agriculture across Africa.</p>
